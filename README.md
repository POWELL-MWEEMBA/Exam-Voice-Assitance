# Exam-Voice-Assitance
# ExamAssistant - Smart AI Exam System for Visually Impaired Users

A comprehensive React Native mobile application designed to provide an accessible exam-taking experience for visually impaired students, with advanced features including voice navigation, speech recognition, offline support, and real-time analytics.

## 🎯 Project Overview

ExamAssistant is a full-stack mobile application built with React Native and Expo that enables:

- **Examiners** to create, manage, and analyze exams
- **Students** (especially visually impaired) to take exams independently using voice commands and accessibility features
- **Research analytics** for evaluating the effectiveness of accessibility features

This project addresses real-world accessibility challenges in educational technology, specifically designed for research.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Traditional exam-taking platforms rely heavily on visual interfaces, creating significant barriers for visually impaired students. These students typically require human scribes or assistive technologies that are expensive, unreliable, or unavailable. Current solutions often:

- Require visual navigation (buttons, menus, text fields)
- Depend on external assistance (human scribes)
- Lack real-time feedback and independent operation
- Fail to provide comprehensive analytics for accessibility research

ExamAssistant addresses this accessibility gap by providing a **fully voice-driven, independent exam-taking experience** that enables visually impaired students to complete exams autonomously without visual dependencies or external assistance.

## 🚀 Key Features

### Voice-Driven Navigation

- Complete exam interaction through voice commands
- No visual UI required for core functionality
- Screen reader compatible architecture

### Simple Command Set

- Intuitive voice commands (e.g., "Read question", "Select option A", "Submit answer")
- Context-aware command processing (commands only work in appropriate screens)
- Reduced cognitive load with minimal command vocabulary

### No Visual Dependency

- Questions and options read aloud via Text-to-Speech (TTS)
- Answers provided via Speech-to-Text (STT)
- Haptic feedback for confirmations and navigation
- Fully accessible without screen interaction

### For Students

- ✅ **Accessibility-First Design**: Voice navigation, speech recognition, and haptic feedback
- ✅ **Offline Support**: Take exams without internet connection with automatic sync when online
- ✅ **Auto-Save**: Answers are automatically saved locally to prevent data loss
- ✅ **Multiple Question Types**: Support for multiple choice and written answer questions
- ✅ **Real-Time Results**: Instant grading and results viewing
- ✅ **Usability Surveys**: Post-exam feedback collection for research

### For Examiners

- ✅ **Exam Creation**: Create exams with multiple question types
- ✅ **Exam Management**: Edit, activate, and manage exam status
- ✅ **Submissions Tracking**: View all student submissions
- ✅ **Research Analytics**: Comprehensive analytics dashboard with:
  - Usage metrics (voice commands, read-aloud requests)
  - Completion rates
  - Feature usage statistics
  - SUS (System Usability Scale) scores

### Technical Highlights

- ✅ **Role-Based Authentication**: Secure Firebase Authentication with role management
- ✅ **Real-Time Database**: Firestore for scalable data storage
- ✅ **Offline-First Architecture**: AsyncStorage for local caching and sync
- ✅ **Context API**: Global state management for authentication and accessibility
- ✅ **Navigation System**: React Navigation with role-based routing
- ✅ **Evaluation Metrics**: Comprehensive tracking system for research purposes

## 🔄 Interaction Flow (CRITICAL)

The system enforces a **strict turn-based interaction model** where TTS completes before STT activates, preventing feedback loops and ensuring reliable voice interaction.

### State Management

         └──────────────┘
```

### Detailed Flow:

1. **TTS Activation** (System Output):

   - User triggers "Read question" command
   - System **stops any active STT** (`stopListening()`)
   - **Waits 500ms** to ensure recognition fully stops
   - Sets `isSpeaking = true` (locks STT)
   - Speaks question text
   - **Waits 300ms** after completion (buffer to prevent feedback)
   - Sets `isSpeaking = false` and calls `onSpeechEndCallback()`

2. **STT Activation** (User Input):

   - User says voice command
   - System **stops any active TTS** (`stopSpeaking()`)
   - **Waits 800ms** to ensure audio fully clears
   - Sets `isListening = true` (locks TTS)
   - Processes recognition result
   - Sets `isListening = false` after processing

3. **State Locking Prevention**:
   - `isSpeaking` and `isListening` are **mutually exclusive**
   - Cannot be `true` simultaneously
   - Prevents microphone from picking up TTS output
   - Prevents TTS from interrupting user commands

### Example Sequence:

```
1. User: "Read question"
   → STT stops → [500ms wait] → TTS starts → "Question 1: What is..."
   → [300ms wait] → STT can resume

2. User: "Select option A"
   → TTS stops → [800ms wait] → STT starts → Processes command
   → Validates context → Executes action → STT stops

3. System: "Selected option A"
   → [500ms wait] → TTS confirms → [300ms wait] → Ready for next command
```

**Key Implementation**: The `SpeechService` class uses explicit state flags (`isSpeaking`, `isListening`) with enforced delays between transitions, ensuring the microphone never captures TTS output and TTS never interrupts user speech.

## ⚠️ Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: TTS and STT Triggering Each Other (Feedback Loop)

**Problem**: When TTS speaks, the microphone could pick up the audio output, causing STT to process system speech as user input, creating an infinite loop.

**Solution**: **Explicit State Locking with Timing Delays**

- Implemented mutual exclusion flags: `isSpeaking` and `isListening` cannot both be `true`
- Added **500ms delay** after stopping STT before starting TTS
- Added **800ms delay** after stopping TTS before starting STT (longer to clear audio buffer)
- Added **300ms buffer** after TTS completion before re-enabling STT
- State transitions are atomic and sequential

```javascript
// From speechService.js
if (this.isListening) {
  await this.stopListening();
  await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 500)); // Critical delay
}
this.isSpeaking = true; // Locks STT
```

**Result**: Zero feedback loops in testing. System reliably distinguishes between user input and system output.

---

### Challenge 2: Misheard Commands or Ambiguous Recognition

**Problem**: Speech recognition may misinterpret commands, especially in noisy environments or with different accents, leading to incorrect actions.

**Solution**: **Command Confirmation Logic + Context Validation**

- Implemented screen context isolation (`ScreenContextService`) - commands only work in their designated screens
- Command validation checks context before execution
- Haptic feedback confirms actions (vibration on selection)
- Users can repeat commands if misheard
- Logging system tracks recognition accuracy for research

**Future Enhancement**: Command confirmation prompts ("Did you say 'select option A'?") for critical actions.

---

### Challenge 3: Screen Context Isolation

**Problem**: Voice commands from one screen could trigger actions on another screen (e.g., "Start exam" command triggering while viewing results).

**Solution**: **Screen Context Service**

- Each screen registers its context (`HOME`, `EXAM`, etc.)
- Commands are validated against current context before execution
- Context changes automatically when navigating between screens
- Prevents cross-screen command interference

```javascript
// From screenContextService.js
isCommandValid(command, context) {
  if (this.currentScreenContext !== context) {
    return false; // Command ignored if wrong context
  }
  return true;
}
```

---

### Challenge 4: Offline Functionality Without Native Network Modules

**Problem**: Need offline support but React Native's NetInfo requires native modules, which complicates setup.

**Solution**: **Fetch-Based Network Detection**

- Used `fetch()` with timeout to check connectivity (polling Google's 204 endpoint)
- Local caching with AsyncStorage for exams and answers
- Queue system for submissions (syncs when online)
- No native dependencies required

**Result**: Works fully offline, syncs automatically when connection restored.

---

### Challenge 5: Real-Time State Synchronization

**Problem**: Maintaining consistent state across multiple screens (authentication, accessibility settings, exam progress) without prop drilling.

**Solution**: **React Context API with Persistent Storage**

- `AuthContext` for authentication state
- `AccessibilityContext` for accessibility settings (persisted to AsyncStorage)
- Singleton services for cross-cutting concerns (SpeechService, ScreenContextService)
- Automatic state persistence and restoration

## 🤖 Use of AI in Development

This project leveraged AI tools strategically to accelerate development while maintaining full code ownership and understanding.

### AI Tools Used:

- **ChatGPT/Claude**: Architecture planning, code review, debugging assistance
- **GitHub Copilot**: Code completion and boilerplate generation

### What Was Accepted:

✅ **Architecture Decisions**: Used AI to explore accessibility patterns and best practices for TTS/STT coordination  
✅ **Code Structure**: Adopted suggestions for service layer pattern and context management  
✅ **Documentation**: AI-assisted in writing comprehensive comments and README sections  
✅ **Bug Fixes**: Used AI to identify edge cases in state management (e.g., TTS/STT overlap)

### What Was Changed:

⚠️ **State Management Logic**: AI suggested simpler approaches, but implemented custom state locking with explicit delays for reliability  
⚠️ **Command Processing**: AI recommended regex-based parsing, but switched to context-aware command matching for better UX  
⚠️ **Error Handling**: Enhanced AI suggestions with comprehensive logging and user feedback

### What Was Rejected:

❌ **Fully AI-Generated Components**: All code was written manually with AI as a reference  
❌ **Complex NLP Libraries**: Rejected heavyweight NLP solutions in favor of simple command matching for performance  
❌ **Auto-Generated Tests**: Wrote manual tests focusing on accessibility edge cases

### AI Fluency, Not Dependency:

- Understood every line of code and can explain architectural decisions
- Modified and debugged AI-suggested code independently
- Used AI as a productivity tool, not a crutch
- Maintained full control over codebase quality and performance

**Key Insight**: AI helped explore solutions faster, but all critical decisions (TTS/STT timing, state management, accessibility patterns) were validated through manual testing and user feedback.

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Expo CLI (`npm install -g expo-cli`)
- Firebase account (for backend services)
- Android Studio (for Android development) or Xcode (for iOS development)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ExamAssistant
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Firebase Setup**

   - Create a Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Enable Authentication (Email/Password)
   - Create a Firestore database
   - Set up Firestore security rules (see `FIREBASE_SETUP.md`)
   - **Configure Environment Variables** (see Environment Configuration below)

4. **Run the application**

   ```bash
   # Start Expo development server
   npm start

   # Run on Android
   npm run android

   # Run on iOS
   npm run ios

   # Run on Web
   npm run web
   ```

### Environment Configuration

The app uses environment variables to securely store Firebase credentials. This prevents sensitive keys from being committed to git.

1. **Create `.env` file** in the root directory:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. **Get your Firebase credentials** from [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/):

   - Go to Project Settings > General
   - Scroll down to "Your apps" section
   - Copy the config values

3. **Fill in `.env` file** with your Firebase credentials:

   ```env
   FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
   FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
   FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project.appspot.com
   FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-sender-id
   FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
   FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your-measurement-id
   ```

4. **Verify `.env` is in `.gitignore`** (it should be already):
   - The `.env` file is automatically ignored by git
   - Only `.env.example` is committed to the repository

> ⚠️ **Important**: Never commit your `.env` file to git. It contains sensitive credentials. The `.env.example` file serves as a template for other developers.
